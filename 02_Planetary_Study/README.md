### Planetary Study
#### By Jakob Glock


This program explores how a spherical object can be deformed by waves. I have used a vertex shader to achieve this using sine and cosine functions.

#### Build Instructions

This program uses ofxGui, you will need to include it when building this project.
ofxGui is already included with OpenFrameworks, so no need to download anything, just include it with the project generator.

You can find my shader files within the 'bin/data' folder, please include the bin folder in the project folder along with the src folder, before building with the project generator.
