### Microscopic Study
#### By Jakob Glock

This program explores the use of springs setup in a grid formation to create a cell wall like structure. This program also generates a Voronoi pattern from these points.

#### Build Instructions

This program uses the Add-on 'ofxVoro', please add this to your add-on folder and include it when building this project from the project generator. You can find this add-on included in this folder!

As a side note, this project was built and tested with OpenFrameworks 0.9.0, I haven't tested it with the latest version. Its should work, but if not try version 0.9.0
